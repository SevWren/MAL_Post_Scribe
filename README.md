# Run and deploy your AI Studio app

This contains everything you need to run your app locally.

## Run Locally

**Prerequisites:**  Node.js


1. Install dependencies:
   `npm install`
2. Set the `GEMINI_API_KEY` in [.env.local](.env.local) to your Gemini API key

## GitHub Pages Deployment

This project has been configured for easy deployment to GitHub Pages. Here's a summary of the setup:

### Tailwind CSS Setup
Tailwind CSS is now managed locally as a development dependency and processed via PostCSS during the build. The CDN script has been removed, and styles are compiled into the project.

### Vite Configuration (`vite.config.ts`)
The Vite configuration has been updated to support GitHub Pages deployment:
- `base: './'`: Ensures that asset paths are relative, which is necessary for sites not served from the root of a domain (common with GitHub Pages).
- `build.outDir: 'docs'`: The output directory for the build is set to `docs/`, as GitHub Pages can be configured to serve from this folder.
- `build.assetsDir: 'assets'`: Specifies that assets like JavaScript and CSS will be placed in an `assets` subdirectory within the `docs` folder.

### Build Process
To build the project for deployment, run:
```bash
npm run build
```
This command performs the following steps:
1. **Cleans the output directory**: `rimraf docs` removes the existing `docs` folder to ensure a clean build.
2. **Builds the application**: `vite build` compiles the React application, processes CSS with Tailwind and PostCSS, and places the output into the `docs` folder.

### Deployment to GitHub Pages
1. **Push your code**: Commit and push all your changes (including the `docs` folder generated by `npm run build`) to your GitHub repository.
2. **Configure GitHub Pages**: In your repository settings on GitHub, navigate to the "Pages" section.
   - Select the branch you want to deploy from (e.g., `main` or `master`).
   - Choose the `/docs` folder as the source for your GitHub Pages site.
   - Save the changes. Your site should be deployed shortly.

### Custom Domain (Optional)
If you wish to use a custom domain with your GitHub Pages site:
- Edit the `docs/CNAME` file and replace its content with your custom domain name (e.g., `www.yourdomain.com`).
- Follow the GitHub documentation for configuring DNS records with your domain provider.
If you are not using a custom domain, you can delete the `docs/CNAME` file or leave it as is; GitHub Pages will ignore it if it doesn't contain a valid domain.

### 404 Page
A custom `docs/404.html` page is included in the build output. This page will be used by GitHub Pages for any routes that are not found. It includes a script to redirect users back to the homepage after a few seconds.
